		<ul>
  			<li>    The subscription includes Docusign help desk support and unlimited envelopes.
			</li>
			<li>
				APR agents also have free access to DigiSign as part of the SkySlope
				transaction management platform. DigiSign and DocuSign are similar products
				and APR does not endorse one ahead of the other. Agents should choose whichever
				digital signature product they are most comfortable working with. 
			</li>
			<li>
				Subscriptions run through November 30, 2018.
			 </li>
		      	<li>
				If you sign up after December 1, 2017, the $130 price is pro-rated to account for the 
				shorter subscription term.
 			</li>
			
					<li>
						To see the current pro-rated price, click the link above.
					</li>
					<li>
						Your account will be activated once your payment has been
					processed, usually within 1-2 business days. Existing individual DocuSign subscribers
					who switch to the APR account will receive a refund from DocuSign of any unused
					portion of their current subscription. Please allow 4-6 weeks for this to 
					process. Month-to-month subscribers will not receive any refund.
					</li>
			
			<li>
				All subscriptions are non-refundable and non-tranferable. 
			</li>
